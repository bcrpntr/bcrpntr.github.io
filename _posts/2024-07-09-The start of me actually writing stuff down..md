# The start of me actually writing stuff down.

Gross.

I am going to start using this as my reflection space each day (as time allows, I'm tired of overextending myself for no reason).
Songs of Survival will become a tag here, as I would like to centralize my blog to a central location.
I have a lot of growth to do, and this will be my space of positivity, as well as learning, so that anyone can view my journeyy if they would like, it's more for me to reflect on as the days go by so don't expect anything phenomenal out of this, unless you enjoy random and unnecessary technical documentation and tangents about clouds.
Let the journey begin, here's to me.

## Highlights of the Day

Today, I went for a hike through Munn Woods twice. It was calming and relaxing, as well as a bit revelational, as I have begun listening to book summaries on Headway as I make my journey.
It was a normal work day today, I learned and worked on Logic Apps for Microsoft Sentinel Playbooks, though unfortunately I created everything in the wrong resource group.
 I guess there's an idea for two technical posts for myself right there, one for the creation of Playbooks, and one for the migration of Playbooks to a new resource group, positives already!
I skipped the gym today, like I have for the last two months, I'm not sure why but my anxiety is back about people watching me and making fun of me there. It's Planet Fitness so that's definitely not an actual concern, just one in my head, but I've got to figure out how to get over it nonetheless.

## Reflection

One thing I learned or realized today was to double check that I actually know what I am doing when creating new things... I was unaware that resource groups need to match for Sentinel Playbooks to run, but I guess I should read the docs better before starting new endeavors.

## Gratitude

Today, I am grateful for my babies, my world would be a lot rougher if I didn't have Quinn and Kamden beside me each day.
