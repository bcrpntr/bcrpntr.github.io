### Reflection Space

I'm starting to use this space for daily reflections (as time allows). I'm tired of overextending myself without reason.

### Songs of Survival

I'm introducing a tag here right off the bat: Songs of Survival. I aim to integrate my existing blogging journey here.

## Let's Begin!

This space will document my growth, serve as a positive outlet, and be a place for learning. While it's mainly for my personal reflection, anyone interested in my journey is welcome to follow along. Expect random technical documentation and tangents about clouds.

**Here's to the journey. Here's to me.**

### Highlights of the Day

**Hiking in Munn Woods:** Today, I hiked through Munn Woods twice. It was calming and relaxing, offering a bit of revelation as I listened to book summaries on Headway.

**Work and Learning:** It was a normal workday. I focused on Logic Apps for Microsoft Sentinel Playbooks but accidentally created everything in the wrong resource group. This mishap gave me ideas for two technical posts: one on creating Playbooks and another on migrating them to a new resource group.

**Skipping the Gym:** I skipped the gym again today, continuing a two-month streak. My anxiety about people watching and judging me is persistent, even though it’s unfounded at Planet Fitness. I need to find a way to overcome this fear.

### Reflection

**Lesson Learned:** Double-checking my work is crucial. I realized I need to read documentation more thoroughly before starting new tasks. Today’s mishap taught me the importance of ensuring resource groups match for Sentinel Playbooks to function correctly.

### Gratitude

**Today, I'm grateful for my children, Quinn and Kamden. They are my world and make each day better.**

Let the mayhem commence!
