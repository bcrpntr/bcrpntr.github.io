title: I’m so overdosed on apathy, and burned out on sympathy

Here I sit, in my bathtub, while I work on my therapy homework, writing about my experiences and traumas in the Army for my appointment tomorrow. I figure while I do that, why not write about a song that has impacted me a lot since my departure?

I have a lot to face, not only from the military, but from the circumstances leading to my decision to join, and my decisions after I was unceremoniously discharged two months after my return from Iraq.

I now understand that I run rather than confront my demons, and that I put them on others because I am afraid of what I have become. I regret not doing the work, and running away from home to Iowa upon my return, I felt hated by everyone, but I now understand that was the hatred I had for myself being projected on those who loved me and wanted nothing more than to be there for me, through the times that I didn’t even understand yet.

I need to stop being self destructive, but that means I need to figure out how to beat this compartmentalization garbage, and learn to love myself (ew). I never understood the compartmentalization before, but now that my mind’s been sufficiently blown up, I understand that I literally packaged myself away, safe from the horrors that I expected from the world, away from everyone who cared about me so that I didn’t impact their lives.

Today’s song kind of hits this all right in the nose, it’s a song that I relate to so heavily that I have lyrics tattooed across my forearms. I share this not for sympathy, but to break out of my apathy. I may have lost my faith in another day, but I can find it again, and I must continue, for myself before anyone else, otherwise I will keep finding myself here again and again, like I have so many times before. The self deprecation isn’t okay, it’s time to do better.

Enjoy.
