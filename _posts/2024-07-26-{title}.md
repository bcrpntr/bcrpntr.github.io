I guess I’m still not ready. This hurts, I want to move past. Too much to deal with currently though, my therapist isn’t confident that I have the focus or time needed to properly process at this time. I can’t say I disagree, but for some reason it still makes me feel like a failure.

I guess we’ll try again next year.
