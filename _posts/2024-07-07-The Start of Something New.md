# Here goes nothing.
For a long time, I have struggled with depression. I've known this. What I haven't known (I guess I've known, but never accepted) is that when I become too depressed, I become incredibly self destructive. I don't make my own decisions. I let the world decide my path. This has not only hurt me, but those I love, so now is the time to face it (years ago would have been ideal, but better late than never). This blog will be my thoughts, knowledge, ideas, things I think are cool, anything I want for once, because this blog is for me. 

Here we go.
