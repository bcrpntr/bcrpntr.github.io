title: I’m so overdosed on apathy, and burnt out on sympathy.

Here I sit, hiding in my bathtub, while I work on my therapy homework, writing about my experiences and traumas in the Army for my appointment tomorrow. I feel safe from the world here, but in reality there is nothing I need to fear anymore, I am not in danger. I figure while I do this, why not write about a song that has impacted me a lot since my departure from that asinine world?

I have a lot to face, not only from the military, but from the circumstances leading to my decision to join, and my decisions after I was unceremoniously discharged two months after my return from Iraq. I never felt that I deserved to be traumatized by it all because of my early release from service, but it impacted me whether I think I deserve to feel it or not, so now it’s time for me to work through it, to grow

I now understand that I run rather than confront my demons, and that I put them on others because I am afraid of what I have become. I regret not doing the work, and running away from home to Iowa upon my return. I felt hated by everyone, but I now understand that was the hatred I had for myself being projected on those who loved me and wanted nothing more than to be there for me, through the times that I was yet to understand.

I need to stop being self destructive, but that means I need to figure out how to beat this compartmentalization garbage, and learn to love myself (ew). I never understood the compartmentalization before, but now that my mind’s been sufficiently blown up, I understand that I literally packaged myself away, safe from the horrors that I expected from the world, away from everyone who cared about me so that I didn’t impact their lives. Life on autopilot is no life at all though.

Today’s song kind of hits this all right in the nose, it’s a song that I relate to so heavily that I have “King of Catastrophes” tattooed across my forearms. While not necessarily a song that helps with surviving, it’s a song that let me know others in the world relate more than I can imagine.

I share this not for sympathy, but to break out of my apathy. I may have lost my faith in another day, but I can find it again, and I must continue, for myself before anyone else, otherwise I will keep finding myself here again and again, like I have so many times before. The self deprecation isn’t okay, it’s time to do better.

Enjoy?
