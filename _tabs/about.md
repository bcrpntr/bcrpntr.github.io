### Welcome to My Journey

Hello! I'm thrilled you've found your way here. My name is Brent Carpenter, and this space serves as a reflection of my life, my growth, and my learning journey. Whether you're here out of curiosity or seeking inspiration, I hope you find something meaningful.

### Who I Am

I'm a cybersecurity engineer with a rich background in IT, holding degrees in computer networking and IT, along with multiple certifications. With over 8 years of experience, including roles in management and as a cybersecurity engineer, I’ve navigated through various challenges and achievements in my professional life.

### Personal Background

My journey hasn't been without its struggles. I have a complex medical and psychological history, including a traumatic brain injury from the military, complex PTSD, and several other conditions. Despite these challenges, I continue to push forward, embracing each day as a new opportunity for growth and resilience.

### Family and Hobbies

I’m a father of two wonderful children, Quinn and Kamden, who are my world. They inspire me to be better every day. When I'm not working or spending time with them, I indulge in various hobbies such as hiking, rucking, building keyboards, homelabbing, skateboarding, and drawing.

### Songs of Survival

I've introduced a tag called "Songs of Survival" to centralize my reflections and blog posts. This tag encapsulates my journey, blending technical documentation, personal growth stories, and random thoughts about clouds and beyond. It’s a testament to my resilience and a space where I can document my progress and setbacks.

### Why This Space Exists

This space is more than just a blog. It's a sanctuary for my thoughts, a canvas for my learning, and a diary of my experiences. It’s where I reflect on my day-to-day life, document technical insights, and share my personal revelations. My goal is to stay positive, keep learning, and maybe inspire someone along the way.

### Join Me

Thank you for stopping by. I invite you to join me on this journey. Whether you're here for technical insights, personal growth stories, or just to see how someone else navigates life’s ups and downs, I hope you find something that resonates with you.

Here’s to the journey. Here’s to growth. Here’s to survival.
